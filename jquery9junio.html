<div class="left">
<p>Ravana resolves to destroy <span class="name" data-person="#rama">Rama</span> by capturing <span class="name" data-person="#sita">Sita</span> with the aid of the rakshasa Maricha. Maricha, assuming the form of a golden deer, captivates Sita's attention. Entranced by the beauty of the deer, Sita pleads with Rama to capture it. Lord Rama chases the deer into the forest, leaving Sita under Lakshmana's guard. After some time Sita hears Rama calling out to her; afraid for his life, she insists that Lakshmana rush to his aid.</p>

<p><span class="name" data-person="#lakshmana">Lakshmana</span> tries to assure her that Rama is invincible, and that it is best if he continues to follow Rama's orders to protect her. On the verge of hysterics, Sita insists that it is not she but Rama who needs Lakshmana's help. He obeys her wish but stipulates that she is not to leave the cottage or entertain any strangers. Lakshmana draws a chalk outline around the cottage and casts a spell on it that prevents anyone from entering the boundary but allows people to exit. Finally, with the coast clear, <span class="name" data-person="#ravana">Ravana</span> appears in the guise of an ascetic requesting Sita's hospitality. Unaware of the devious plan of her guest, Sita is tricked into leaving the chalk outline and is then forcibly carried away by the evil Ravana.</p>

<p><span class="name" data-person="#ravana">Ravana</span> carries <span class="name" data-person="#sita">Sita</span> away to Lanka, where Sita is kept under the heavy guard of rakshasis. Ravana demands Sita marry him, but Sita, eternally devoted to Rama, refuses. Rama and Lakshmana learn about Sita's abduction from Jatayu, and immediately set out to save her. During their search, they meet the demon Kabandha and the ascetic Shabari, who direct them towards Sugriva, the monkey king, and Hanuman.</p>

<p><span class="name" data-person="#hanuman">Hanuman</span> travels secretly to Lanka and observes Sita as she is held captive. Receiving Hanuman's report, Rama and Lakshmana proceed with their allies toward the shore of the southern sea. There they are joined by Ravana's renegade brother Vibhishana. The monkeys construct a giant floating bridge across the ocean, which the princes and their army cross to invade Lanka. A lengthy battle ensues, in which Rama eventually kills Ravana, and Sita is rescued.</p>

<h3>Ravana</h3>
<p>A rakshasa, the king of Lanka (current-day Sri Lanka).

He is portrayed as a powerful demon king who disturbs the penances of rishis (ascetics who practice austerities in the forest). Vishnu incarnates as the human Rama to defeat him, thus circumventing the boon given by Brahma.</p>
